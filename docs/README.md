# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub! This README provides a concise summary of our project management approach and direct links to all process documentation for onboarding and team reference.

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme runs projects through a five-stage, iterative lifecycle:

- **Initiation:** Validate business need, define stakeholders, goals, and success metrics. Capture these in a Project One-pager and obtain approvals before proceeding.
- **Planning:** Break approved work into actionable backlog items with clear acceptance criteria, estimates, and owners. Develop a release plan, milestones, and identify risks and dependencies.
- **Execution & Tracking:** Teams track delivery using a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), run daily standups, and conduct demos and reviews for milestones. Small PRs are encouraged, CI runs tests and linting, and at least one approval is required for merges.
- **Risk Management & Communication:** Maintain a risk register, use defined escalation paths (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor), provide weekly and milestone-based updates to stakeholders with standardized templates.
- **Release & Deployment:** Releases use checklists, pre-release criteria, staged rollouts, and rollback plans to ensure quality and safety.
- **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement:** Each milestone or incident is followed by a retrospective. Action items are tracked in the backlog for continuous improvement.

### Key Roles & Personas

- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and stakeholder communications.
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Owns product outcomes, defines and prioritizes backlog, and validates success.
- **Developers:** Build and test features; uphold code quality.
- **QA:** Verifies acceptance criteria and maintains test plans before release.
- **Stakeholders:** Provide input and approvals at key stages.

### Communication & Quality Assurance

Communication is structured (standups, demos, stakeholder updates), and quality is ensured through acceptance criteria, automated tests, security scans, manual QA, and documented processes for escalation and rollback.
